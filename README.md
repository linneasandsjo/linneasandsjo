## Hi! 👋 
I'm Linnea, a fourth-year ICT engineering student at LTH, specializing in software engineering!


* 📱 I'm currently developing PinPoint — an iOS app using SwiftUI, Firebase, MapKit and Google Places SDK.

* 🌐 I recently built Flora Web Shop, a secure multi-layer PHP application with protections against SQLi, XSS, CSRF and more.

* 🍽️ I’ve also created a recipe generator in React with live search, API integration and recipe saving.


⛰️ Outside tech I love hiking, skiing, running and cooking!!


Feel free to reach out through any of my links! 🚀
